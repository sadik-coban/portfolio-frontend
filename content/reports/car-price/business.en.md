# Used Car Market Analysis — Decision Note

**For:** the pricing team and the dealership. **Decision:** the model can serve as the primary reference in a price-suggestion tool, but not on its own for cheap (below ₺1.15M), comparable-less or old (roughly 18+) cars. **Gain:** about ₺81K less pricing error per car. **Limit:** it predicts the asking price, not the sale price.

## What's it worth?

**The comparable median** — *the middle price of the same model and year; with no comparable that year, the model's all-year median, and failing that the whole market's* — misses by **₺191K** on average; the model by **₺110K** — **43% better**, **₺81K** per car. Across a 100-car stock that is about **₺8M** of pricing error. On the listings that do have a comparable (97.5%) the baseline misses by ₺179K and the model by ₺106K: ₺73K per car, 41%.

Beyond model and year the gap is closed mostly by mileage and damage: removing them from the model grows the (root-mean-square) error by ₺55K and ₺25K respectively. The engine information is largely in the model name already: removing that group on its own adds only ₺524.

**Without a comparable the baseline collapses** — mean error at the bottom tier is **6.1×** the top. The model struggles without comparables too — where, further down.

| baseline tier | listings | share | mean error |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| model + year | 29,236 | 97.49% | ₺179K |
| model | 596 | 1.99% | ₺559K |
| global | 156 | 0.52% | ₺1.10M |

## How this market builds a price

How much each driver moves the price — **with everything else held fixed**:

| driver | price |
|---|---:|
| age (per year, at a typical car) | -6.6% |
| mileage (per 100k km, at a typical car) | -15.1% |
| heavy-damage record | -11.6% |
| changed panel (each) | -3.1% |
| painted panel (each) | -1.1% |
| +100 hp of engine power | +19.9% |

Age and mileage are linked axes; the age and km rows above are each measured with the other held fixed, at a typical car (11 years, 181,000 km).

**Brand gives you nothing to act on.** Adding brand on top of series+model does not move the mean error — brand already lives inside model.

## Where not to trust the number

In **percentage** terms the model struggles on cheap cars — error varies sharply by price quartile.

**In lira the picture flips.** The largest share of total lira error (39.7%) sits in Q4; mean absolute error is ₺176K in the most expensive quartile and ₺77K in the cheapest. Grouped by the predicted price (the only thing the tool knows) the model is not noticeably biased in any quartile: the slope of actual on predicted price is 1.003.

**The fewer the comparables, the higher the large-miss rate (beyond ±20%).** With no other listing of the same model and year the rate is 19.0%; with 100+ comparables 2.9%. Top/sport segments (19.1%) and cars aged 18 or older (12.0%) are risky too; overall 4.0%.

### Why a range, not a single number

An asking-price error costs money in both directions: **over-estimating hits the buyer** — they overpay; **under-estimating hits the seller** — the car goes too cheap. A single number hides how sure the estimate is; a range states it and warns the user exactly where uncertainty is large.

That is why the output is a **90% range**, not one number. But the range does not hold on cheap cars: actual coverage in the cheapest quartile is **81.6%**, below target.

**What to do**

- Widen the range on cheap cars — don't trust a point estimate.
- Price rare and edge cars by hand; the model scatters there.
- Review a listing whose text mentions a conversion, an engine swap or modifications before it goes live: that information is not in the form. With vehicle attributes held fixed no significant difference in its error rate was measured; the review guards against what the form cannot see, not against model error.
- **Watch drift and retrain the model:** run a service that tracks the price distribution, and retrain the model on new data. The price distribution moves little today (highest PSI 0.005), but the market level moved +2.0% over four snapshots and the model is time-blind.
- **Watch for events that reset the pricing regime** (a tax or excise change, an incentive, a sudden market move) — plan retraining around them. Do not discard old snapshots: more data means less error.

## What this model does not give you

- **The sale price.** It predicts the asking price; the sale price lands below it after haggling.
- **Causation.** These are controlled associations; it won't say "repaint it and the price drops".
- **The value of one specific damaged car.** The model sees damage at panel and panel-group level (painted · changed · heavy-damage record) but not its **severity**: a light scratch and a deep dent land on the same "painted" flag.
- **Equipment beyond the package, and modifications.** The trim package in the model name (M Sport, S Line and the like) is read; options outside the package and later changes are not visible.
- **Anything outside BMW and Audi.** Scope is these two brands; how far it generalises to other brands was not measured.

**Scale:** 29,988 listings, 4 scrape snapshots. **Data:** 2026-01-18 – 2026-06-27. Median asking price ₺1.55M.
